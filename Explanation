Project Steps
1. Data Collection
Files used: DEMO24Q4.txt, DRUG24Q4.txt, REAC24Q4.txt, OUTC24Q4.txt.

Source: FAERS

2. Data Cleaning and Merging
Filtered DRUG for primary/secondary suspect drugs.

Merged with DEMO, REAC, and OUTC on primaryid.

Label: serious = 1 if adverse outcome in OUTC data, else 0.

3. Feature Engineering
Selected key features (e.g., age, sex, route of administration, drug name).

Encoded categorical variables.

4. Modeling
Trained XGBoostClassifier for classification of serious ADRs.

Evaluated performance with accuracy and SHAP analysis.

5. Explainability
Used SHAP summary plots to show which features influenced the predictions.

Example: Age, sex, and drug route showed strong impact on prediction.

#Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

SHAP for model interpretability

Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda environment)

FAERS public dataset (FDA)

#Results

Achieved accurate prediction of serious ADRs.

SHAP helped interpret how patient attributes and drug characteristics influenced risk.

#Learnings

Hands-on with end-to-end machine learning on healthcare data.

Applied explainable AI for better transparency in pharmacovigilance.

Learned how to clean and merge large datasets efficiently.
