#Title

Explainable AI for ADR Detection using FAERS Dataset

#Description

This project applies machine learning and SHAP explainability techniques to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) dataset to detect and understand patterns behind serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

#Goals

Predict whether an ADR is serious based on patient and drug data.

Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to make model predictions interpretable.

Build a beginner-friendly yet impactful project for learning and sharing.
